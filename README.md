# Multiplication_With_Any_Given_Base
The purpose of this project was writing an algorithm that multiplies two numbers in a given base between 2-10. The output will be given in both decimal and the given base form.
- The numbers can be of infinity length
- The numbers are stored in a Linked List
- This project works from the cmd
- The input will be taken from an input file
- The output will be written into an output file

This project teaches us the following:
- Using the code from the cmd
- Usage of input and output files
- Function Prototypes
- Pointers to create linked lists
- malloc/calloc
